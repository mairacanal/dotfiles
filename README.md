# dotfiles

A collection of all my vim, zsh and tmux configs. I'm still trying to organize them and remove some useless configuration.

## How to Use?
The hole environment can be built through the `install.sh` file. So, to use this config and install my favorite apps, just run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/mairacanal/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Some Information

- **Theme:** Gruvbox
- **Plugin Manager:** Vim Plug
- **Distro:** Fedora 34
- I added primarily plugins for Markdown, JavaScript, Python and C/C++.
- *Why so many plugins?* I don't like to keep it simple, I like to keep it easy.
