## Tools 

- **Operating System:** Fedora 41 or Mac OS Sequoia
- **Colour scheme:** [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord)
    - The terminal is currently using [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com)

### GNOME Configuration

I use a mix of [Graphite Nord Compact](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Graphite-gtk-theme)
and a custom GNOME shell theme. For icons, I use
[Papirus Dark](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) and set the folders
using [Papirus Folders](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-folders) to the **nordic**
color. I usually use the [Pop Shell](https://github.com/pop-os/shell) extension as well.
