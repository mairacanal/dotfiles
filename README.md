# dotfiles

A collection of all my vim, zsh and tmux configs. I'm still trying to organize them and remove some useless configuration.

## Some Information

- **Theme:** Gruvbox
- **Plugin Manager:** Vim Plug
- I added primarily plugins for Markdown, JavaScript, Python and C/C++
- *Why so many plugins?* I don't like to keep it simple, I like to keep it easy.
- Usually, I use Fedora 34 as my distro.
- **Dependencies:**
    - zsh-syntax-highlighting: installed using packages
    - oh-my-zsh: installed via GitHub
